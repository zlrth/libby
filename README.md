## configuring your host machine for the sql database

first you install mysql, following some of these directions: https://coderwall.com/p/os6woq/uninstall-all-those-broken-versions-of-mysql-and-re-install-it-with-brew-on-mac-mavericks . ignore most of it. just do like brew update and brew upgrade and brew install and then (important!):

mysql.server start

mysql -uroot

then, inside mysql: create database bookwarrior;

now exit mysql with control-d.

now, assuming everything's done, do this: mysql -u root -p bookwarrior < backup_libgen.sql

it should take minutes.

you are ready to learn sql queryies!

once you've mysql -uroot'd, don't forget to use bookwarrior;

to check that it works, try select title from updated where md5 = '67BA5CC5A7118784770ED996B348C0FD';

the result should be: Clojure Applied: From Practice to Practitioner









then you start the service.
